        <p>I've always had a major sweeet tooth! No matter how full I was after dinner, there was always room for dessert. At first I would fix box cakes, but quickly switched to baking from scratch after deciding to experiment with different ingridents. My family loved being by taste testers and began asking me to bake for different events like birthdays and Christmas. Once the pandemic hit I started to experiment more with cookeis, but didn't want to eat all the leftovers so I started selling them to friends. The demand increased and Brown Sugar Treats was born!  </p>
